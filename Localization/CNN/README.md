# Localization with a CNN
See <a href="LEGO Vision/Detection/CNN/FasterRCNN">Detection</a> for the localization implementation.

Simply run "run_faster_rcnn.py" with the localization config that can be found in <a href="LEGO Vision/Detection/CNN/FasterRCNN/configs">configs</a>. This means that you will just be pointing to another dataset which includes localization type images.

For further instructions on how to use the Faster R-CNN implementation see <a href="LEGO Vision/Detection/CNN/FasterRCNN/README.md">the CNTK Faster R-CNN readme</a>
